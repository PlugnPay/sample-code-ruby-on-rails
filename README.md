This community built, Ruby On Rails API, was originally written by Ryan Porter,
Senior Software Architect at VenueDriver.com & was released as an open-source
community project on GitHub.

The ruby-plugnpay project can be found on GitHub, at 
"https://github.com/VenueDriver/ruby-plugnpay/".  As of the initial release
there was a basic implementation of PlugnPay's API authorization mode.
However the developer plans to support additional API functions.

Please refer to this project on GitHub for additional details & usage.

This 3rd party API should asset Ruby developers, who wish to impliment our
API payment method within Ruby On Rails applications.  This library can also
be used in Ruby programs that are not Rails apps.  The API contains unit tests,
documentation, and instructions on installation and usage.

This project on GitHub was relased as open-source, so you can use it for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and make any derivative works you like from it,
with attribution.


***** IMPORTANT NOTE *****
This code is NOT officially supported by Plug 'n Pay Technologies.  As such, this
module is being provided "AS IS".  If you have problems using/implimenting this
3rd party Ruby API, please seek support assistance via this project's page on the
